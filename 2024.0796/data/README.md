# Real Datasets

Here are the real data sets (.R file) needed for replicating the experiments reported on in the paper  \[Fast multinomial logistic regression with group sparsity](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2024.0796) by Sheng Fu, Shixiang Li, Kai Yu, Piao Chen, and Zhisheng Ye. The detailed description is as follows.


* The USPS handwritten digit data are primarily sourced from http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/MLData.html. This dataset consists of 9298 grayscale images of handwritten digits, automatically digitized from envelopes by the U.S. Postal Service. Each image was centered and standardized to display a variety of font styles. The dataset has 256 features, corresponding to pixel values, and 10 classes, representing the digits 0 through 9.
* The Activity recognition data are primarily sourced from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+recognition+using+wearable+physiological+measurements. This dataset contains physiological data collected from volunteers to recognize various activities and emotional states. During the study, several segments of movies and documentaries were played to elicit specific activities from the participants. The dataset comprises 4,480 samples, each with 533 features derived from physiological sensors. Four distinct activity classes are included: neutral activity, emotional activity, mental activity, and physical activity, each with 1120 samples.
* The MADELON data are primarily sourced from https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/datasets.html. The MADELON dataset was generated for the NIPS 2003 feature selection task and consists of 2600 samples and 500 features. The data points were created in 32 clusters on the vertices of a five-dimensional hypercube, with each sample labeled as either +1 or -1 at random. In addition to the informative features, many irrelevant features were introduced, making the dataset challenging for feature selection tasks.
* The ISOLET data are primarily sourced from https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/datasets.html. The ISOLET dataset is a speech recognition dataset where 150 participants spoke the names of all 26 English letters, with each letter being pronounced twice. This resulted in 900 instances with 617 features, representing the spectral features extracted from the speech recordings. There are 15 classes corresponding to the 26 letters, with each class having 60 samples.
* The credit card data are primarily sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data. This dataset contains 284807 credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It includes 28 numerical features derived from the transformation by principal component analysis, which serve as inputs for classification. There are two classes: fraudulent transactions and legitimate transactions. Due to the size limit, this data file is divideded into three parts.
